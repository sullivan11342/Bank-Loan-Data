# Bank-Loan-Data
This Report highlights and visualizes KPIs with regards to bank loan information.

In this project, you will see both my Power BI dashboard, as well as my SQL queries detailing the KPIs displayed. 

1. Total Loan applications: Calculated the total number of loan applications received during a specified period. Additionally we are tracking to see month-to-date (MTD) loan applications as well as changes month-over-month (MoM). 
2. Total Funded Amount: Understanding the total amount of funds disbursed as loans is crucial. We want to see the MTD total funded amount and analyze the month-over-month changes in this metric.
3. Total Amount Received: Tracking the total amount received from borrowers is essential for assessing the bank's cash flow and loan repayment. We should analyze the month to date total amount received and observe the month over month changes.
4. Average Interest Rate: Calculating the average interest rate across all loans, MTD, and monitoring the month-over-month variations in interest rates that will provide insights into our lending portfolio's overall cost.
5. Average Debt-to-Income Ratio: Evaluating the average DTI for our borrowers helps us gauge their financial health. We need to compute the average DTI for all loans, MTD, and track month over month fluctuations.
